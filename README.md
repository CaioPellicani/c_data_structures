# Data Structures in C


* This little project begin from the need to learn more about data structures.

* There's no clear objectives beside learning.

* One of the requisite of my aproach for the data structures is that they function as an library for generic types, so learning about __void pointers__ and __function pointers__ was needed

* The data structures is not focus on the securite, with this understanding that it comes with NO WARRANTY

* The project needed automatized tests that was developed based on [minunit tests](http://www.jera.com/techinfo/jtns/jtn002.html)
